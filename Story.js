 ${mainHero.name} had been accepted to train as one of the ${mainHero.race} king's
 champions. Heart beating furiously in anticipation, ${mainHero.name} entered the palace's
 training grounds.
 
 A burly man stood in the center of the grounds surrounded by people that looked just as 
 amazed as ${mainHero.name} felt. Feeling that was the right place to be, ${mainHero.name}
 joined the group.

 a weapon rack on the side of the grounds.`

the palace. Those of you who succeed, will be allowed to progress to real champion training."`);

Steeling yourself, you follow the guard into the palace and down a set of stair. You stop at a door with two guard standing at attention.
You are instructed that you must go to the far end of the dungeon and retrieve a special coin. If you return with it, you will progress.`);

torchlight coming from the walls, you can see that all of the cells in the dungeon are open, and broken bits of furniture are littered
throughout the room. You hear a sound and manage to catch a glimpse of a goblin ripping into a fluffed chair.`);
